INDIGO Python's documentation
=============================

In this site let's talk about a implementation of a library INDIGO in Python. You can learn more about original `INDIGO <https://www.indigo-astronomy.org>`_ and how works.

You can see the source code in `GitHub <https://github.com/Gogilga/INDIGO-Python-Bib/tree/main>`_ to understand all you need to use this library. The repository is ordered in two folders:

* `project <https://github.com/Gogilga/INDIGO-Python-Bib/tree/main/project>`_: Here is the source code of the library, as well as an example of a small program that serves as an INDIGO client.
* `docs <https://github.com/Gogilga/INDIGO-Python-Bib/tree/main/docs>`_: This section contains all the files required to produce this documentation.

Let's, the documentation will have the following structure:
